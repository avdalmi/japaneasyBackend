      name: "Pickled Herring",
      description: "Herring pickles are a local dish that conveys the history of the herring industry in Hokkaido. From the late Edo period to the Meiji period, the herring fishery flourished in Hokkaido, especially along the Sea of Japan. In spring, when large schools of herring rushed to the coast to spawn, the sea was dyed pure white. The herring catch peaked in the Meiji era, and there was a period of close to 1 million tons of landings, but from around the 30s of the Showa era, the number of herrings decreased sharply, and almost no herring could be caught. Currently, herring is often caught in lakes such as Lake Akkeshi and its surroundings, but the catch is far from the peak.",
